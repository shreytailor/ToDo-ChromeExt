# Simple To-Do Web Application

### Summary
After finishing my first JavaScript course from Udemy, this was created to sharpen up my skills and to test whether I could apply everything that I learnt into something practical.

### Usage Instructions
- To add a To-Do item, type it in the textbox and then press the enter key.
- To mark an item as being completed, click on it.
- To remove an item completely from the list, click it again.
- To get rid of all the items, press the 'Delete All' button.

### Functionality
To store the individual items, I have used the localStorage of browsers. This way even if the tab is closed, the items are retrieved the next time you open the webpage.
